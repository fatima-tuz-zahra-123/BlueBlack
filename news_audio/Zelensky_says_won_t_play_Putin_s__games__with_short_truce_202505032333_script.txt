Welcome to Dawn News. Zelensky says won’t play Putin’s ‘games’ with short truce. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed a three-day truce ordered by Russian leader Vladimir Putin as theatrics, but said Kyiv was ready for a full ceasefire.  Moscow said the truce, set to coincide with its World War II commemorations on May 9, was aimed at testing Kyiv’s “readiness” for long-term peace, accusing Zelensky of making a “direct threat” to events on the holiday.  The Kremlin rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by Kyiv and Washington in March, and Putin has since offered little to end the three-year Russia invasion.  “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part.  Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” Zelensky said. Thank you for listening to Dawn News.
