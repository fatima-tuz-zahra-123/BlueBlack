Welcome to Dawn News. Warren Buffett to step down as Berkshire CEO, Vice Chairman Abel to take over. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Influential billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Saturday he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, and hand over the reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel.  “I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive of the company at year end,” Buffett, 94, said at Berkshire’s annual meeting.  He said Abel hadn’t been aware of his plans prior to the announcement.  Buffett also said he had “zero” intention of selling any of his Berkshire stock.  The news was also unexpected, though Buffett said he had told his children about his decision. Thank you for listening to Dawn News.
