Welcome to Dawn News Update. Security forces kill 5 terrorists, arrest 2 in KP operations: ISPR. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Five terrorists were killed and two were apprehended in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted by the security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Saturday.  Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.  “Five Khwarij were sent to hell, while two were apprehended during three separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the ISPR said.  Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.  In the first of the three operations, an IBO was conducted by the security forces in Bajaur District on the reported presence of terrorists. This is Dawn News, reporting from Pakistan.
