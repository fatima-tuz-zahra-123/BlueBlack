<speak>Hello, I'm your Dawn News presenter with the latest developments. Pakistan envoy to US calls on world to resolve Kashmir dispute, terms it ‘core issue’ of enmity with India. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Here are the details. As we understand it, Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has called on the global community to resolve the Kashmir dispute, terming it the “core issue” of the recent complete breakdown of ties with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.  The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.  India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military.  As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “ resolute” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict. That's all for this update. Stay with Dawn News for more developments as they happen.</speak>
