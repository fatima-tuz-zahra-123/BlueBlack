Welcome to Dawn News. Gaza journalists killed banner. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Israelâ€™s war on Gaza over the last 18 months has not only claimed the lives of over 50,000 people but also turned the enclave into one of the most dangerous places on earth for journalists.  This repository is an attempt to memorialise the sacrifices of the over 250 journalists who have been killed by Israeli forces, either while performing their duties or simply attempting to stay alive in the enclave.  Some were killed alone or with their colleagues; others were wiped out along with their entire families.  In the case of Wafaa Ali Al-Odaini, she was killed alongside her husband and two children when an Israeli strike flattened their home in the Gazan city of Deir Al Balah.  With foreign journalists banned from entering Gaza by Israel citing security reasons, it is these local journalists who were transmitting to the world the atrocities committed by Israeli forces. Thank you for listening to Dawn News.
