Welcome to Dawn News. Pakistan reacted responsibly despite India’s provocative actions: PM Shehbaz. This World Press Freedom Day, we pay tribute to the over 250 brave journalists who laid down their lives in Gaza in pursuit of the truth since Oct 7, 2023. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Pakistan’s reaction had been responsible and measured so far despite India’s provocative actions following severe tensions between the two countries in wake of the Pahalgam incident.  The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000.  India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military.  As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict. Thank you for listening to Dawn News.
